Hello! This is a simple todo list web application I attempted to build using node.js and express.js. I wanted to build something that was useful, has a simple design, and also to teach me how different programs work together (html, css, node.js, express.js).

Please note, I build this as part of a tutorial series from The Net Ninja on YouTube.
